Change Component Description : Designator=U4 Old Description=The PCM1802 is a high-performance, low-cost,
single-chip stereo analog-to-digital converter with
single-ended analog voltage input. The PCM1802
uses a delta-sigma modulator with 64-times or
128-times oversampling, and includes a digital
decimation filter and high-pass filter (HPF), which
removes the DC component of the input signal. For
various applications, the PCM1802 supports master
and slave modes and four data formats in serial
interface. The PCM1802 is suitable for a wide variety
of cost-sensitive consumer applications where good
performance, 5-V analog supply, and 3.3-V digital
supply operation is required. The PCM1802 is
fabricated using a highly advanced CMOS process
and is available in the DB 20-pin SSOP package. New Description=The PCM1802 is a high-performance, low-cost,
